          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold ">What is Marker?</h2>
          <p>Marker is a writing platform that helps writers better understand, express, and refine their ideas. We're building software that acts as a thinking partner – using AI thoughtfully to help writers develop their voice and craft, not replace it.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold">What you'll do at Marker</h2>
          <p>We're looking for a mid-level Product Designer to own and evolve Marker's design system across desktop, app, and mobile. This role is ideal for someone with strong product and visual instincts—particularly someone drawn to utilitarian (but expressive), typography-led design rather than highly illustrative or photographic work. You should care deeply about creating software that helps writers think, rather than software that thinks for them.
            <br/><br/><strong>Here are some examples of areas you will be working in:</strong></p>
          <ul class="list-disc ml-4 space-y-1">
            <li>Create, own, and evolve our design system across desktop, app, and mobile platforms</li>
            <li>Design interfaces that feel natural to writers and support deep thinking</li>
            <li>Work closely with our co-founder and Chief Product Officer, as well as with our engineering team, to push the product forward visually and experientially</li>
            <li>Help define the visual language and interaction patterns that make Marker distinctive</li>
            <li>Balance craft with pragmatism; knowing when to iterate and when to polish</li>
            <li>Be a part of the early team to guide the future of our products and company at large</li>
            
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="text-2xl">What we can offer</h2>
          <ul class="list-disc ml-4 space-y-1">
            <li>A calm, human-friendly work environment among kind and experienced professionals</li>
            <li>Fun, creative, novel, and interesting work at the intersection of AI and creativity</li>
            <li>An opportunity to work with and learn about the latest advancements in AI and its use in augmenting human creativity</li>
            <li>Direct collaboration with leadership to shape how we understand and improve our product</li>
            <li>As much responsibility and growth opportunities as you want to take on</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="text-2xl">Are you a good fit for this role?</h2>
          <p class="font-semibold">In order to be successful in this role, you will recognise yourself in the following:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc ml-4 space-y-1">
            <li>You have experience creating, owning, and evolving design systems for applications on desktop, app, and mobile</li>
              <li>You have strong product and visual instincts, with a lean towards typographic utility</li>
              <li>You deeply care about writers interacting with software that helps them think rather than thinks for them</li>
              <li>You're comfortable working in a fast-paced, early-stage environment</li>
              <li>You can move quickly while maintaining high standards</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="font-semibold mt-4">An exceptional candidate for this role would be able to demonstrate some of the
            following:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc ml-4 space-y-1">
            <li>Experience as a hybrid designer/product feature creator using AI tools—someone who works daily in both Figma and Cursor</li>
            <li>Being a writer yourself (fiction, non-fiction, essays)</li>
            <li>Experience designing for Rich Text Editing interfaces or collaborative writing tools</li>
            <li>A portfolio that demonstrates thoughtful, restrained design work focused on typography and interaction</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="font-semibold mt-4">However, you are NOT expected to:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc ml-4 space-y-1">
            <li>Be a software engineer - we're looking for visually oriented product designers who care deeply and systematically about the user experience</li>
            <li>Have experience with every aspect of our tech stack</li>
            <li>Have a degree in Design — we value practical experience and portfolio work over credentials</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
