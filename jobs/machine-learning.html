          <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold ">What is Marker?</h2>
          <p>Marker is an AI-native Word Processor – a reimagining of Google Docs and Microsoft Word.</p>
          <p>Join us in building the next generation of agentic AI assistants supporting serious writers in their work.
          </p>
          <p>We are a small, ambitious company using cutting-edge technology to give everybody writing superpowers.</p>

        <section>
          <h2 class="text-2xl ">What you'll do at Marker</h2>
          <p>We are looking for someone with a couple of years experience in academia or industry who can help us bring
            rigour and insight to our AI systems through evaluation,
            research, and observability. You'll work directly with Ryan Bowman (CPO) to help us understand and improve
            how our AI assists writers. Here are some examples of areas you will be working in:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc ml-4 space-y-1">
            <li>Design and implement evaluation frameworks for complex, subjective AI outputs (like writing feedback
              that's meant to inspire rather than just correct)</li>
            <li>Build flexible evaluation pipelines that can assess quality across multiple dimensions - from human
              preference to actual writing improvement</li>
            <li>Research and prototype new evaluation methodologies for creative and subjective AI tasks</li>
            <li>Collaborate with our engineering team to integrate evaluation insights into our development process</li>
            <li>Help define what "quality" means for different AI outputs and create metrics that actually matter for
              our users</li>
            <li>Work on challenging problems like: "How do we automatically evaluate whether an AI comment successfully
              encourages thoughtful revision?"</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="text-2xl">What we can offer</h2>
          <ul class="list-disc ml-4 space-y-1">
            <li>A calm, human-friendly work environment among kind and experienced professionals</li>
            <li>Fun, creative, novel, and interesting technical work at the intersection of AI research and product
              development</li>
            <li>An opportunity to work with and learn about the latest advancements in AI evaluation and language models
            </li>
            <li>Direct collaboration with leadership to shape how we understand and improve our AI systems</li>
            <li>As much responsibility and growth opportunities as you want to take on</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="text-2xl">Are you a good fit for this role?</h2>
          <p class="font-semibold">In order to be successful in this role, you will recognise yourself in the following:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc ml-4 space-y-1">
            <li>You have experience with AI/ML evaluation methodologies and can speak the language of AI research</li>
            <li>You've worked hands-on with language models and understand the challenges of evaluating subjective,
              creative outputs</li>
            <li>You are a self-starter willing to work independently and at speed - we imagine a 2-week experiment
              cadence at most.</li>
            <li>You are familiar with and have worked on related technical systems (evaluation pipelines, data
              collection tools) but don't need to be a full-stack engineer. You won't be expected to build these alone!
            </li>
            <li>You think critically about what metrics actually matter and aren't satisfied with vanity metrics</li>
            <li>You're comfortable working with ambiguous problems where the "right answer" isn't obvious</li>
            <li>You have some programming experience (Python preferred) and can work independently on technical projects
            </li>
            <li>You're interested in the intersection of AI capabilities and human creativity</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="font-semibold mt-4">An exceptional candidate for this role would be able to demonstrate some of the
            following:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc ml-4 space-y-1">
            <li>Experience building evaluation systems for generative AI in production environments</li>
            <li>Knowledge of TypeScript and ability to integrate with our existing systems</li>
            <li>Background in human-computer interaction, computational creativity, or writing research</li>
            <li>Experience with A/B testing, statistical analysis, and experimental design</li>
            <li>Familiarity with modern AI observability and monitoring tools</li>
            <li>Published research or deep interest in AI evaluation methodologies</li>
            <li>Interest in writing (fiction, non-fiction, essays)</li>
          </ul>

          <p class="font-semibold mt-4">However, you are NOT expected to:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc ml-4 space-y-1">
            <li>Be a senior software engineer - we're looking for someone who can build evaluation systems, not
              architect our entire backend</li>
            <li>Have solved every evaluation problem before - this is cutting-edge work and we're figuring it out
              together</li>
            <li>Be experienced with every library in our stack from day one - you'll work closely with Ryan and our
              engineering team</li>
            <li>Have a specific degree - we value practical experience and research ability over credentials</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h2 class="text-2xl ">Our stack</h2>
          <p class="font-semibold">You'll be working with the following technologies:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc ml-4 space-y-1">
            <li>Our AI engine uses a range of models, including self-hosted and fine-tuned open source models, as well
              as latest reasoning models from Anthropic and OpenAI</li>
            <li>Evaluation and research tools built primarily in Python, with integration into our TypeScript
              infrastructure</li>
            <li>Our agentic AI execution platform is written in TypeScript, hosted on Cloudflare Workers</li>
            <li>Standard ML tooling: various evaluation frameworks, data analysis tools, and monitoring systems</li>
            <li>Our text editor frontend is a web application built with React, TypeScript and ProseMirror</li>
          </ul>
